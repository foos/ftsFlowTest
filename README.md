# FTS flow api automated testing

This command line app is to automate the checking of results from the flow API endpoints to the classic API endpoints.

From the command line, just call the file directly with arguments.

e.g.
 ```
node planCompare.js 2013

 ```

 Then with the values from this output

 ```
node flowCompare.js 851 954
 ```

 Note that there are file paths to be configured in the files itself.
